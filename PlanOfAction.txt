Phase-1: the first non-negotiable core features (MVP)

These are the ones that make your product actually feel like a note app — and are technically feasible early.

Rich-text editor

bold/italic/underline

headings

bullet / numbered lists

paste image

paste link

drag to reorder blocks (optional, but ideal)

This is the single hardest part to get right — but also the most critical.

Hierarchical note organization

Notebook → Section → Page OR

Folder → Page

Choose one — don’t mix both initially.

Autosave + Sync

every keystroke saved automatically

saves occur silently

no “Save” button

Full-text search

search page title + note body text

(this is where tools like Elasticsearch / Meilisearch / Typesense often enter, but you can start with Postgres Full Text Search)

Authentication + ownership

users can create account

sign in/out

notes tied to logged-in user

That is enough to ship something that feels “real”.

Phase-2: high value upgrades after MVP

Sequentially:

drag/drop images + attachments

tags / labels

offline-edit support

multiple cursors (collab) → CRDT / OT

OCR on images (Vision API)
